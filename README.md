# Beatriz Strobel's Portfolio

## Description
I designed and developed my portfolio from scratch. I started by building lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes on Figma. Then I built the file and folder structure for the app on Visual Code. I developed the app using React, and I styled it with the component library Chakra UI. The app is light weight and modular, every section on the homepage is it's own separate React component. Finally, I conducted accessibility testing and improved my designs.
